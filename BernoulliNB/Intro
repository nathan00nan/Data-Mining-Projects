1. Imports the required libraries: pandas, numpy, CountVectorizer, train_test_split, GridSearchCV, BernoulliNB, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, and confusion_matrix. 
2. Reads the data from a CSV file located at "C:\Users\pumpk\Desktop\Nathan's File\DOCUMENTS\My Notes\Projects\BernoulliNB.csv" into a pandas DataFrame. 
3. Selects only the "CONTENT" and "CLASS" columns from the DataFrame. 
4. Maps the values in the "CLASS" column from 0 and 1 to "Not Spam" and "Spam Comment" respectively. 
5. Converts the "CONTENT" and "CLASS" columns into numpy arrays. 
6. Initializes a CountVectorizer object for text feature extraction. 
7. Transforms the "CONTENT" column into a sparse matrix of token counts using the CountVectorizer. 
8. Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split, with a test size of 0.2 and a random state of 42. 
9. Defines a parameter grid for hyperparameter tuning of the BernoulliNB model. 
10. Initializes a BernoulliNB model. 
11. Performs a grid search with 5-fold cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. 
12. Retrieves the best model and best parameters from the grid search. 
13. Evaluates the accuracy of the best model on the test set. 
14. Makes predictions on the test set using the best model. 
15. Calculates precision, recall, and F1 score for the predictions. 
16. Computes the confusion matrix for the predictions. 
17. Prints the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and best hyperparameters.
