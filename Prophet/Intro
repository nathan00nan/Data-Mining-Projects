1. Read the data from a CSV file and convert the date column to a datetime format.
2. Rename the columns to match the required input format for Prophet.
3. Create an instance of the Prophet class and set the desired parameters, including holidays, seasonality, and priors.
4. Fit the model to the data.
5. Specify the number of forecast periods and generate future dates for prediction.
6. Use the trained model to make predictions on the future dates.
7. Calculate evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
8. Plot the predicted values against the actual values using Plotly.
