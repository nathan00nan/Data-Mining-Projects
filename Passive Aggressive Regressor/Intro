1. Imports the required libraries: pandas, numpy, train_test_split, PassiveAggressiveRegressor, mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, and r2_score. 
2. Reads the data from a CSV file located at "C:\Users\pumpk\Desktop\Nathan's File\DOCUMENTS\My Notes\Projects\Passive Aggressive Regressor.csv" into a pandas DataFrame called "data". The encoding is set to 'latin1'. 
3. Drops any rows with missing values from the DataFrame. 
4. Separates the features (x) and target (y) variables from the DataFrame. 
5. Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split, with a test size of 0.2 and a random state of 42. 
6. Initializes a PassiveAggressiveRegressor model. 
7. Fits the model to the training data. 
8. Makes predictions on the test set. 
9. Calculates the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual values. 
10. Prints the MSE. 
11. Calculates the mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted and actual values. 
12. Prints the MAE. 
13. Calculates the R-squared (R2) score between the predicted and actual values. 
14. Prints the R2 score. 
15. Creates a new feature array for prediction. 
16. Predicts the impressions using the trained model and the new features. 
17. Prints the predicted impressions.
