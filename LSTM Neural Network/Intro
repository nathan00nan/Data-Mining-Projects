1. Imports the required libraries: pandas, numpy, train_test_split, Sequential, Dense, and LSTM from Keras. 
2. Reads the data from a CSV file located at "C:\Users\pumpk\Desktop\Nathan's File\DOCUMENTS\My Notes\Projects\LSTM Neural Network.csv" into a pandas DataFrame called "data". 
3. Defines the radius of the Earth (R) and helper functions "deg_to_rad" and "distcalculate" for distance calculation. 
4. Adds a new column "distance" to the DataFrame and calculates the distance between the restaurant and delivery location using the "distcalculate" function. 
5. Prepares the features (x) and target (y) variables from the DataFrame. 
6. Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split, with a test size of 0.10 and a random state of 42. 
7. Initializes a Sequential model. 
8. Adds two LSTM layers with 128 and 64 units respectively, followed by Dense layers with 25 and 1 unit. 
9. Prints a summary of the model's architecture. 
10. Compiles the model with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function. 
11. Trains the model on the training data for 9 epochs with a batch size of 1. 
12. Asks for user input to provide the age, ratings, and total distance for predicting the delivery time. 
13. Creates a feature array from the user input and predicts the delivery time using the trained model. 
14. Prints the predicted delivery time.
