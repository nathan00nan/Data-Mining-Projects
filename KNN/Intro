1. Imports the required libraries: pandas, KNeighborsClassifier, train_test_split, GridSearchCV, accuracy_score, and numpy. 
2. Reads the data from a CSV file located at "C:\Users\pumpk\Desktop\Nathan's File\DOCUMENTS\My Notes\Projects\KNN.csv" into a pandas DataFrame called "iris". 
3. Prints the unique target labels in the "species" column of the iris DataFrame. 
4. Separates the features (x) and target (y) variables from the iris DataFrame. 
5. Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split, with a test size of 0.2 and a random state of 0. 
6. Defines a parameter grid for hyperparameter tuning of the KNeighborsClassifier model. 
7. Initializes a KNeighborsClassifier model. 
8. Performs a grid search with 5-fold cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. 
9. Retrieves the best parameters and best score from the grid search. 
10. Initializes a new KNeighborsClassifier model with the best parameters. 
11. Fits the new model to the training data. 
12. Creates a new data point (x_new) for prediction. 
13. Makes a prediction on the new data point using the best model. 
14. Prints the prediction. 
15. Makes predictions on the test set using the best model. 
16. Calculates the accuracy of the predictions compared to the true labels. 
17. Prints the accuracy.
